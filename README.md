#  Quemath
An[SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE) optimized math library for games, written in C99.

## About
Quemath is a general purpose header-only library that provides well tested functions for vector, quaternion and matrix math. It can easily be used with or without OpenGL, for rendering, physics, etc.

## Features
Quemath features a robust, but focused API that descends from the math library of the venerable [Quake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)) engine. Features include:
 * Integer vectors
  * Arithmetic operators
  * Logical operators
* Floating point vectors
 * Arithmetic operators
 * Logical operators
 * Triginometric operators
  * Dot product
  * Cross product
  * Normalize
  * Fast normalize
* Quaternions
 * Euler angle interoperability
 * Matrix generation
* Floating point matrices
 * Rotate, translate and scale
 * Invert
 * Transpose
* Fast psuedo-random number generators
